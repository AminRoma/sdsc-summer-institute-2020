# Preparing for the Summer Institute: Software Requirements

While many of the hands-on activities will be run on Comet, some sessions require that customized software be installed on **your laptop**. Please perform the following software installations and file downloads prior to the event. Note: several of the preparation activities will provide information and guidance on how to install the required software components.

### Preparation: Using Jupyter Notebooks <a name="notebooks"></a>

Some sessions and tutorials will be using *Jupyter Notebooks*. Running Juypter notebooks relies on you handling your own python package installation. It was designed with *Anaconda* in mind. This is a common package manager used for data science, but it it not recommended for use on HPC systems and running jupyter notebooks remotely. Anaconda is a large package and has a lot of overhead. For best performance, we recommend using *Miniconda*, which is a free minimal installer for *conda* (an open source package management system and environment management system that runs on Windows, macOS and Linux). *conda* is a small, bootstrap version of Anaconda that includes only conda, Python, the packages they depend on, and a small number of other useful packages.

For installation and usage instructions, please see the [SDSC Notebooks 101 Tutorial](https://comet-notebooks-101.readthedocs.io/en/comet/)

To learn more about Notebooks, see the [Jupyter/IPython Notebook Quick Start Guide](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

### Parallel session: Machine Learning Overview (scheduled opposite Scientific Visualization with Visit) <a name="mach-learn"></a>

Participants who will be attending the Machine Learning Overview parallel session will need to install R (https://www.r-project.org/) and RStudio Desktop open source edition (https://www.rstudio.com/) on their laptops. 

A basic understanding of R will be very helpful and we recommend the following resources:

* https://cran.r-project.org/doc/contrib/Torfs+Brauer-Short-R-Intro.pdf
* https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html

### Parallel session: Scientific visualization with Visit (scheduled opposite Machine Learning Overview) <a name="visit"></a>

Participants who will be attending the Scientific visualization with Visit session on Thursday morning should make the following preparations.

* Computer, mouse with scroll wheel are required (tablets are not sufficient for this tutorial).

* [Download](https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/visit/executables) and install VisIt version 3.0.1 (**the latest version**). Please do not compile from source unless you are adventurous

* Test run VisIt application on your laptop to make sure it works

* Download sample data: [visit_data_files.tar.gz](https://wci.llnl.gov/content/assets/docs/simulation/computer-codes/visit/visit_data_files.tar.gz). Unzip to your desktop

* Download [Comet host profile for VisIt-3.0.x](http://users.sdsc.edu/~amit/comet/visit3.0.x-comet-host-profile.zip).  
    Unzip and copy this file as follows  
    Linux and Mac: ~/.visit/hosts/  
    Windows: C:/users/username/Documents/visit/hosts/   
    Restart VisIt
