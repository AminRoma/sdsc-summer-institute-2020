# Preparing for the Summer Institute 2020
You will get the most out of the SDSC Summer Institute if you are prepared prior to the event. By brushing up on your knowledge of Linux and installing all necessary software on your laptop before to the event, youâ€™ll be able to focus your attention on the skills and topics that are most relevant to high performance and data intensive computing.

To help you get the most out of your week, this section contains a set of detailed start-up instructions, beginning with setting up your account and connecting to Comet to configuring your laptop for running visualization software. Please read the documents and exercises carefully, and complete all necessary steps before event. Feel free to ask questions or if you have any problems with the start-up tasks

Note: if you have any difficulties completing these tasks, please contact Institute staff at consult@sdsc.edu.

##  Computer Requirements:
* We would recommend a second screen for the hands-on sessions. The first to view the presentation, the second for hands-on.
* For visualization tutorial a mouse with scroll wheel is highly recommended (laptop track pads are very difficult to use for 3D navigation).

##  Account Requirements:
* You will be given an account on the SDSC Comet computer. Information on the account will be sent to you via email. Please complete the process of activating your account before the institute begins.

##  Github Account: 
* If you do not already have a GitHub account, please create one.
