## Lightning rounds

Slides have been concatenated into a single slide deck named concatenated_reduced.pdf with reduced image sizes since the full-resolution presentation was too large to load into GitHub (at least using the web interface). This directory also contains the original, full-resolution slides for each Summer Institute attendee who participated in the Lightning Round.

### Overview

Wednesday afternoon of the Summer Institute, we will be holding a Lightning Round. This is a
longstanding tradition where all participants are asked to present two slides describing (1) their
work or research and (2) their computational challenges and what they hope to accomplish
from attending the Summer Institute.

MORE DETAILS TO COME.
